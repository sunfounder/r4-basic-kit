Lesson 14 Infrared-Receiver
================================

Introduction
------------------

An infrared-receiver is a component that receives infrared signals and
can independently receive infrared ray and output signals compatible
with TTL level. It's similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor
in size and it is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and
infrared transmission.

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: img/l14_receiver.png


**Step 2:** Open the code file.

**Step 3:** Select the **Board** and **Port.**

**Step 4:** Upload the sketch to the board.

After uploading the codes, you can see that the current value of the pressed button of IR Remote Controller displays on the serial monitor.


    * The ``IRremote`` library is used here, you can install it from the **Library Manager**.

.. Note::

    * There is a transparent plastic piece at the back of the remote control to cut off the power and pull it out before you use the remote control.
    * Please gently press the button on the remote to avoid invalid data FFFFFFFF.

Code Analysis
---------------------

This code is designed to work with an infrared (IR) remote control using the ``IRremote`` library. Here's the breakdown:

#. Include Libraries: This includes the IRremote library, which provides functions to work with IR remote controls.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        #include <IRremote.h>

#. Defines the Arduino pin to which the IR sensor's signal pin is connected and declares a variable to store the last decoded IR value.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        const int IR_RECEIVE_PIN = 11;  // Define the pin number for the IR Sensor
        String lastDecodedValue = "";  // Variable to store the last decoded value

#. Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600. Initializes the IR receiver on the specified pin (``IR_RECEIVE_PIN``) and enables LED feedback (if applicable).

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void setup() {
            Serial.begin(9600);                                     // Start serial communication at 9600 baud rate
            IrReceiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);  // Start the IR receiver
        }

#. The loop runs continuously to process incoming IR remote signals.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void loop() {
            if (IrReceiver.decode()) {
                String decodedValue = decodeKeyValue(IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command);
                if (decodedValue != "ERROR" && decodedValue != lastDecodedValue) {
                    Serial.println(decodedValue);
                    lastDecodedValue = decodedValue;  // Update the last decoded value
                }
                IrReceiver.resume();  // Enable receiving of the next value
            }
        }
    
    * Checks if an IR signal is received and successfully decoded.
    * Decodes the IR command and stores it in ``decodedValue`` using a custom ``decodeKeyValue()`` function.
    * Checks if the decoded value is not an error and is different from the last decoded value.
    * Prints the decoded IR value to the serial monitor.
    * Updates the ``lastDecodedValue`` with the new decoded value.
    * Resumes IR signal reception for the next signal.
