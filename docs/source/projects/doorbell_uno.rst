Lesson 4 Doorbell
=========================

Introduction
-----------------

A buzzer is a great tool in your experiments whenever you want to make
some sounds. In this lesson, we will learn how to drive an active buzzer
to build a simple doorbell.

Experimental Procedures
-------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit (Long pins of buzzer is the Anode and the
short pin is Cathode).

**Step 2:** Open the code file.

**Step 3:** Select the **Board** and **Port.**

**Step 4:** Upload the sketch to the board.

Now, you should hear the buzzer beep.

Code Analysis
-----------------

**Define variables**

.. code-block:: arduino

    const int buttonPin = 2; //the button connect to pin2

    const int buzzerPin = 8; //the led connect to pin8

    /**********************************/

    int buttonState = 0; //variable for reading the pushbutton status

Connect the button to pin 2 and buzzer to pin 8. Define a variable
*buttonState* to restore the state of the button.

**Set the input and output status of the pins**

.. code-block:: arduino

    void setup()

    {

        pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); //initialize the buttonPin as input

        pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT); //initialize the buzzerpin as output

    }

We need to know the status of the button in this experiment, so here set
the *buttonPin* as INPUT; to set HIGH/LOW of the buzzer, we set
*buzzerPin* as OUTPUT.

**Read the status of the button**

.. code-block:: arduino

    buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

buttonPin(Pin2) is a digital pin; here is to read the value of the
button and store it in ``buttonState``.

**digitalRead (Pin)**: Reads the value from a specified digital pin,
either HIGH or LOW.

**Press the button to make the buzzer sound**

.. code-block:: Arduino

    if (buttonState == HIGH ) //When press the button, run the following code.
    { 
        for (i = 0; i < 50; i++) 
        /*When i=o, which accords with the condition i<=50, i++ equals to 1 
        (here in i = i + 1, the two "i"s are not the same, but i(now） = i（before） + 1). 
        Run the code in the curly braces: let the buzzer beep for 3ms and stop for 3ms. 
        Then repeat 50 times.*/

        { 
            digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH); //Let the buzzer beep.
            delay(3); //wait for 3ms
            digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW); //Stop the buzzer.
            delay(3); //wait for 3ms 
        }

        for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) //Let the buzzer beep for 5ms and stop for 5ms, repeat 80 times.
        { 
            digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
            delay(5); //wait for 5ms
            digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
            delay(5); //wait for 5ms 
        }
    }

In this part, when the **buttonState** is High level, then let the
buzzer beeping in different frequency which can simulate the doorbell.
