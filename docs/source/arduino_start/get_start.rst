Get Started with Arduino
=======================================

.. Arduino is an open source platform with simple software and hardware.
.. You can pick it up in short time even if you are a beginner. It provides
.. an integrated development environment (IDE) for code compiling,
.. compatible with multiple control boards. So you can just download the
.. Arduino IDE, upload the sketches (i.e. the code files) to the board, and
.. then you can see relative experimental phenomena. For more information,
.. refer to http://www.arduino.cc.

.. Please follow the tutorial below to learn how to install the Arduino IDE, add libraries and upload code.

If you have no idea about Arduino. There are several words I would like to show you: electronics, design, programming, and even Maker. Some of you may think these words are quite far away from us, but in fact, they are not far at all. Because Arduino can take us into the world of programming and help us realize the dream of being a Maker. 
In this session we will learn: 

* What is Arduino?
* what can Arduino do? 
* How to build an Arduino Project?

What is Arduino?
-----------------

First of all, I will give you a brief introduction to Arduino.

Arduino is a convenient, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source electronic prototyping platform, including hardware Arduino boards of various models and software Arduino IDE. It is not only suitable for engineers for rapid prototyping, but also artists, designers, hobbyists, while it is almost a must-have tool for modern Makers.

Arduino is quite a large system. It has software, hardware, and a very huge online community of people who have never met each other but are able to work together because of a common hobby. Everyone in the Arduino family is using their wisdom, making with their hands, and sharing one great invention after another. And you can also be a part of it.

What can Arduino do?
---------------------

Speaking of which, you may have doubts about what Arduino can actually do. Suffice it to say, Arduino will solve all your problems.

Technically speaking, Arduino is a programmable logic controller. It is a development board that can be used to create many exciting and creative electronic creations: such as remote-controlled cars, robotic arms, bionic robots, smart homes, etc. 

Arduino boards are straightforward, simple, and powerful, suitable for students, makers and even professional programmers. 

To this day, electronics enthusiasts worldwide continue to develop creative electronic creations based on Arduino development boards.
